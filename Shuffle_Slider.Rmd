This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 



This will import the CSV file

```{r}
#plot(cars)
install.packages("usethis")
install.packages("git2r")
```

```{r}
firstmeta = read.csv(sep = ",", header = TRUE, "C:\\Users\\koehlerd\\Desktop\\Classes\\Sem 2 Year 4\\Senior Project\\Datasets\\Metadata(1).csv")
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


```{r}
summary(firstmeta)
head(firstmeta)

```



```{r}
##set.seed(234)
train_indicies = createDataPartition(mydata$CONTROLVARIABLE, p = 0.8, list = FALSE) # splits data up 80% training 20% testing
train_data = mydata[train_indicies, ]
test_data = mydata[-train_indicies,]
```



# this is the KNN algorithm itself, this will be updated once we get data imported
```{r}
k = UNKNOWN_YET

predicted_values = knn(train_data[, x], test_data[, x], train_data$CONTROLVARIABLE, k)
```

# to test the accuracy of the model (will output a percetage)

```{r}
accurate = mean(predicted_values == test_data$CONTROLVARIABLE)
cat("Accuracy of model:", accurate)
```
